                    Depending on the popularity, scope and sales of the The 777 Club NFT project, We reserve the right to adjust, change or reduce the roadmap displayed on https://the777.io. Our roadmap, which is displayed on the777.io, includes a part that will named “Post Sell-Out” containing elements that we will execute and realize only if the collection sells out. If the collection does not sell out, the execution of these elements will be at our sole discretion and may be cancelled or reduced. Our roadmap includes the acquisition of a land in the Metaverse. However , please note that we have no share in the Metaverse and no control over it. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the user experience and users will have to abide by the terms and conditions of the Metaverse. At the moment, the land would be in Sandbox Metaverse, but this could change depending on several factors, including the popularity of projects offering an immersive experience in the Metaverse.
                    This project is strictly an NFT art project that could eventually provide utilities for its holders. However, we do not guarantee any profitability for the buyers and it is understood that this is not the goal or the reason of the project. This project should not be considered as an investment. The main goals of this project are to promote art, to have fun and to have utilities for the holders.
                    As part of this project, we offer several giveaways. Depending on the popularity, scope and sales of the The 777 Club NFT project, we reserve the right to reduce or cancel or reduce these giveaways. If we draw prices that are physical goods, we reserve the right to pay the equivalent of the prize in ETH instead of giving the physical prize.
